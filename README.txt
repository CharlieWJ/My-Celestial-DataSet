Currently finishing up. However, this projects implements a list interface to construct my own ArrayList and LinkedList data structures. Using these I constructed a Celestial Bodies database to include a list of different types of Stars present in our universe.

The Stars compatible with the data base are Sequence Stars, White Dwarfs, and Red Giants. Finally, I will find the biggest and the brightest stars in our universe of objects while watching out for black holes.

Inside the code, there are also comments that detail my thought process.

Thank you very much.

Best,
Charlie
