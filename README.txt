This projects implements a list interface to construct my own ArrayList and LinkedList data structures. Using these I constructed a Celestial Bodies database to include a list of different types of Stars present in our universe.

The Stars compatible with the data base are Sequence Stars, White Dwarfs, and Red Giants. This project is no longer being worked on, however some methods do not work to perfection.

Inside the code, there are also comments that detail my thought process.

Thank you very much.

Best,
Charlie
